<ul>

<li>The costs of cyber security breaches are rising: Organisations that suffer cyber security breaches may face significant fines. There are also non-financial costs to be considered, like reputational damage.</li>

<li>Cyber attacks are increasingly sophisticated: Cyber attacks continue to grow in sophistication, with attackers using an ever-expanding variety of tactics. These include social engineering, malware and ransomware.</li>

<li>Cyber security is a critical, board-level issue: New regulations and reporting requirements make cyber security risk oversight a challenge. The board needs assurance from management that its cyber risk strategies will reduce the risk of attacks and limit financial and operational impacts.</li>

 <li>Cyber crime is a big business: According to a 2020 study by McAfee and the CSIS, based on data collected by Vanson Bourne, the world conomy loses more than $1 trillion each year due to cybercrime. Political, ethical, and social incentives can also drive attackers.</li>
